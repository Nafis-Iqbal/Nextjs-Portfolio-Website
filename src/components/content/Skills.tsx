            <p>My Go To framework of choice. Rapid fast prototyping and development with minimum friction and a focus on enhancing site SEO capabilities. And
                because NextJs works like a full stack framework with lots of features that a dedicated backend can offer, this is my preferred choice for most web
                projects where time is of the essence, & developers are short in number.</p>
                <br></br>
            <p>With a well built E-Commerce site under my belt, lots of coding hours with react, and a thorough understanding of NextJS basics and principles,
                this is the framework where I feel at home working with.</p>

            <p>Hailed as one of the best frontend libraries, React empowers me to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces with ease. Its component-based 
                architecture allows for reusable code, making development faster and more efficient.</p>
                <br/>
            <p>Along with a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools like react-icons, framer-motion, React has become my go-to choice for building modern web applications.</p>

            <p>Due to it&apos;s unopinionated nature, ExpressJS gives me the flexibility to structure my applications as I see fit. Whether it&apos;s a 
                simple API or a complex web app, Express has the tools I need to get the job done.</p>
                <br/>
            <p>On top of possesing development speed and flexibility, expressJS uses javascript/typescript as it&apos;s language, which is a huge plus for me as a full stack developer.</p>

        briefDescription: <p>I like Laravel for its elegant syntax and powerful features that make backend development a breeze. It&apos;s batteries included approach to 
            development, with a rich set of built-in tools and libraries, allows me to focus on building great applications without getting bogged down in boilerplate code.
            <br/>
            While I prefer using expressJS for backend development, I do enjoy working with Laravel for certain projects, specially when some feature is better suited for it.
